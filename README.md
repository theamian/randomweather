This is a final project for CS50x. It randomly selects a city and shows you its current weather conditions and spot on the map as well as some info about the country the city is in. You can choose between metric and imperial units and search for a specific city instead of just loading random ones. The city list was pulled from OpenWeather.

The project was built using Flask as it was the framework used in the course.
APIs used are OpenWeather, REST Countries and Google Maps.
Bootstrap is used for most of the styling.
